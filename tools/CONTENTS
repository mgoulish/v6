There are two ways of exploring and manipulating images. You can write a
program to do whatever you want, or you can use command-line tools for
a more interactive, one-step-at-a-time experience.

The 'tools' directory contains small programs that are meant to be used 
as command-line tools.

All tools except tif2whd use ehd images.
